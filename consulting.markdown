## Tecnology Advisory / Fractional CTO

- Building a technical roadmap / vision
- Working with non-technical stakeholders or customers
- Making a hiring plan for founding engineer(s) and leadership
- Mentorship / coaching of engineering managers or very senior individual contributors

I have advised several seed-stage and Series A companies, a few traditional small businesses, and a few large enterprise companies.

## Software Development

I'm generally available on short notice to deliver high quality work in small, fast chunks (most of my projects are about 100–150 hours long, and typically about 10–15 hours/week).

I'm most familiar with:

- **Frontend**: React, Javascript, GraphQL/REST APIs
- **Mobile**: iOS (Swift + ObjC), React Native
- **Backend**: Ruby, Node.js, Python, Java, Kotlin
- **Data**: ETLs, Airflow/Dagster, SQL, streaming, SFTP/API/scraping

I'm a strong generalist and have working experience with most popular programming languages, databases, and network infrastructures.

## Pricing

Pricing varies by project. I would love to hear about your project and provide an estimate or a few options.
