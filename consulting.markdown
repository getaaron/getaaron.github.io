## Software Development

I'm generally available on short notice to deliver high quality work in small, fast chunks (most of my projects are about 100–150 hours long, and typically about 10–15 hours/week).

I'm most familiar with:

- **Frontend**: React, Javascript, GraphQL/REST APIs
- **Mobile**: iOS (Swift + ObjC), React Native
- **Backend**: Ruby, Node.js, Java, Kotlin

That said, I'm a strong generalist and have at least some working experience most popular programming languages, databases, and network infrastructures.

### Pricing
Pricing varies by project. I would love to hear about your project and provide an estimate or a few options. 

## Engineering Management Coaching

I'm available for mentorship / coaching of new engineering managers or individual contributors who want to become engineering managers.

## Writing

I enjoy writing and editing and sometimes will provide consulting on content marketing, technical documentation, and more. A few examples:

- [ThoughtWorks: Choosing the right mobile development tools: part one](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/choosing-right-mobile-development-tools-part-one)
- [ThoughtWorks: Choosing the right mobile development tools: part one](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/choosing-right-mobile-development-tools-part-two)
- [Building the Brex API](https://www.brex.com/journal/building-the-brex-api/)

I also enjoy writing on Stack Overflow, especially when I can help beginners grasp a complex concept; I'm in the top 1% of answerers. Examples:

- [Proper Use of `@weakify(self)` and `@strongify(self)`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29436402/1445366)
- [How do I update my forked repo using SourceTree?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13273853/1445366)
- [Lesser than or greater than in Swift switch statement](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31656822/1445366)
