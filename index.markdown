I'm a full-stack software engineer knowledgeable in distributed systems and mobile application development. I have domain experience in financial services (including payments processing, risk, underwriting, card issuing, and global expansion) and travel (airline and hotel), among others.

I'm also the author of the [Look Busy](https://lookbusy.app) mobile app.
